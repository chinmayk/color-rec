\Subsection{query-system}{Query System}
Google Images is queried for images from  the category.
\Subsection{statistical}{Statistical summarization}
We assume that the images from the category are a random sampling from the concept-space of the category. Taking this assumption further, we look at the {\em average} frequencies of the different colors as a metric of how concepts are shared across the values in a category.

\begin{align}
Old = \alpha*average + (1-\alpha)*new \\
  new = \frac{(old - \alpha*average)}{(1-\alpha)} 
\end{align}

Since we are interested in the colors specific to a category value, we substract a fraction of the average color frequency. 

\Subsection{clustering}{Clustering}
We cluster the result to get relevant colors in LAB space. We found that low saturation colors are less likely to be relevant, 
so we reweight more saturated colors to be more relevant.
