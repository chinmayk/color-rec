What is the color of anger? Or of Japan, or of profit? Data analysts and laymen alike often need to implicitly answer questions like these in an attempt to create compelling visualizations. Using colors has been known to increase time performance and accuracy in reading visualizations~\cite{hoadley1990investigating}, and designers have long used relevant colors to increase aesthetic appeal. In this work, we make a first attempt at aiding the process of finding the right colors for a visualization through a mixed initiative interface, \system.

\system consists of two distinct components: the first attempts to find candidate colors for a given topic (such as ``Japan''). The second attempts to combine candidate colors for a number of topics (say ``countries'') into a single coherent palette, using guidance from the user.

Through this paper, we make two contributions. First, we show that finding candidate colors for a topic can be completely automated. Second, we develop a mixed initiative system that finds coherent palettes, and discuss how this system can be used. Finally, we hope \system is a step that makes color somewhat less mystical and more accessible to a non-designer.
