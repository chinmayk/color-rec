What is the color of anger? Or of Japan, or of profit? Data analysts and laymen alike often need to answer questions like these in an attempt to create compelling visualizations. Using colors has been known to improve time performance and accuracy in interpreting visualizations~\cite{hoadley1990investigating}, and designers have long used colors to increase aesthetic appeal. In this work, we present a system that aids the process of finding the right colors for a visualization through a mixed initiative interface.

\system consists of two components: the first finds candidate colors for a given topic (such as ``Japan''). The second combines candidate colors for a number of topics (say ``countries'') into a single coherent palette, using guidance from the user.

Through this paper, we make two contributions. First, we show that finding candidate colors for a topic can be completely automated. Second, we develop a mixed initiative system that finds coherent palettes. Finally, we hope \system is a step that makes color somewhat less mystical and more accessible to a non-designer.
