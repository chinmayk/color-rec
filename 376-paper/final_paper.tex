%%
%% Note on formatting authors at different institutions, as shown below:
%% Change width arg (currently 7cm) to parbox commands as needed to
%% accommodate widest lines, taking care not to overflow the 17.8cm line width.
%% Add or delete parboxes for additional authors at different institutions. 
%% If additional authors won't fit in one row, you can add a "\\"  at the
%% end of a parbox's closing "}" to have the next parbox start a new row.
%% Be sure NOT to put any blank lines between parbox commands!

\abstract
Is it possible to automatically create a color palette relevant to a topic? Could such a palette be used to guide color choices while visualizing data? We envision a tool that automatically creates aesthetically pleasing and topic-relevant palettes for a  large class of topics. In order to do this, we must first extract palettes from color pixel values of images from Google Images via clustering and topic models.
